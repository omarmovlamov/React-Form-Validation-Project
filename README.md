# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This React project includes two components that facilitate form management and validation. The "General" component provides basic form fields for email, age, and password validation.The "Portal" component offers an advanced user registration form, handling fields like username, university selection, and terms acceptance.

In the "General" form, users can fill in fields for email, age, password, and password confirmation, with basic validation rules applied. The "Portal" form, on the other hand, enforces more complex validation, including username, university selection, and acceptance of terms.

*The project utilizes popular React libraries like "formik" and "yup" for form management and validation. It also leverages React Router DOM for smooth transitions between pages.</i>*
